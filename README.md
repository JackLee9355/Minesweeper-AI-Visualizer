Userguide:

This is a personal project to visualize a minesweeper AI. I previously made a proof of concept for this AI in Java.

The entire project runs on the client browsers. This was primarily done to ease hosting and to demonstrate/learn fundamental Javascript skills, particularly web workers. However, this means a tech-savvy user could easily cheat by using inspect element. This does not concern me much. The primary purpose of this project is to show off the AI, not create a competitive game of Minesweeper.

There are few features that I am still planning to implement to improve the user experience.
