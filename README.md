# Minesweeper-AI-Visualizer

[View this project here!](https://jacklee9355.github.io/Minesweeper-AI-Visualizer/)

This is a personal project to visualize a minesweeper AI. I previously made a proof of concept for this AI in Java.

The entire project runs on the client browsers. This was primarily done to ease hosting and to demonstrate/learn fundamental Javascript skills, particularly workers. However, this means a tech-savvy user could easily cheat by using inspect element. This does not concern me much. The primary purpose of this project is to show off the AI, not create a competitive game of Minesweeper.

Things I learn in the course of this project:
 - Frontend Javascript
 - Web workers
 - Grounded my knowledge of computational complexity (This program does not work in a satisfactory manner with less efficient implementation of algorithms.)

TODO:
 - Improve the front end look a lot
